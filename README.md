## Setup
All dependencies are defined in the [Gemfile](Gemfile), which can be installed by running ```gem install bundler```, followed by ```bundle install```.

## Preview
An automatically building preview can be started by executing ```rake site:preview```, and viewed in the browser by visiting http://localhost:4000/.

## Build
This is an unnecessary step because GitHub will build automatically.
A manually build can be completed by running ```rake site:build```

## Deploy
Commit to GitHub on the gh-pages branch.
